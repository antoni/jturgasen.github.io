Etsy has an interesting aspect to their culture that they call "blameless post-mortems".  You can find articles on it [here](http://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) and [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/etsy-chad-dickerson-blameless-post-mortem-2012-5).

In a nutshell here's how it works:

* Find out what happened and how to make it better, not who to blame.
* People already feel guilty when they break something, there's no reason to make it worse, that adds nothing.
* Assume that people had good intentions.  99.9999% of the time the person didn't break it on purpose.
* Assume everyone is smart and competent.  If they weren't, they wouldn't have been hired and/or wouldn't still be with the company.
* Treat the post-mortem as a learning experience, not a witch hunt.
* Blameless culture encourages taking ownership and sharing mistakes.  If a person knows they won't get yelled at they are more likely to speak up and share what happened.
* Blame culture creates an adversion to innovation, mistakes and change.
* Share your story.  To help build the culture, talk about a time you blew something up.  I know I have!

Like Harvard Business Review has taught us over and over, this change *must come from the top down* if it is to succeed.  Even if all the workers agree to create a blameless culture that doesn't mean their boss or their bosses boss will share the view, but when the CxO pushes it everyone will accept it.
