Tech Takeaways are notes from technical videos, presentations, and slide decks.  Unlike text, these formats are not always easily searchable so it's better to take notes because you can't just Google it.  Also, some videos may have information or discussions that are not part of the PowerPoint deck.

Be sure to understand that these are my *personal* notes so they may be messy (I wrote it, I understand it) and they might be missing information (I already know it so I'm not going to write it down again).

I may create more formalized presentations in the future, but for right now Tech Takeaways are my personal notes and if people can get some information out of them I'm happy to share.
