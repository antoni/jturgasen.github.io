DevOps is a mentality / culture and not a set of tools yadda yadda yadda - but if you want to get into DevOps you need to know the tools too!  Open source tools are free but the SaaS / hosted ones cost money, right?  Nope!  Here's a little list of things you can use to get started.

Shamelessly taken from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/2jddbq/junior_3_years_systems_engineer_looking_for/).  I won't name any of the on-premise tools because you can find links to most of them in my [OSS tools](https://github.com/jturgasen/my-links) repo on GitHub.

* [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) - Get a free micro size instance for 12 months.  Includes access to most AWS tools and services, just watch your limits!
* [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) - A clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with the Red Hat logos removed
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - Super simple virtualization / hypervisor, great for Windows and OS X / Mac users
* [Python](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) - Tons of free tutorials and courses on the web, Google around to find more
* [Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby) - Tons of free tutorials and courses on the web, Google around to find more
* [Hosted Chef](https://www.getchef.com/chef/#plans-and-pricing) - Learn Chef using Hosted Chef, up to 5 nodes for free.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Free, online, public Git repos
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/plans) - Hosted continuous integration (CI), 100 builds for free
* [PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com/pricing/) - Free for 14 days
* [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/plans-and-pricing/) - 200 megs of storage and 7 days of retention for free
* [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing) - Free New Relic Pro and New Relic Lite trials

That should keep you busy for a while.  Need to learn a new on-premise tool?  Spin up some VMs with VirtualBox + CentOS and go nuts.  Need to learn a new SaaS / hosted product?  They probably have a free trial or free tier.
