I'm about half done with [the SRE book](https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X), I've got [the microservices book](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Sam-Newman/dp/1491950358?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0), and [the architecting for scale book](https://www.amazon.com/Architecting-Scale-Availability-Growing-Applications/dp/1491943394?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) is on the way.  Work is giving me plenty of learning opportunities every day.  The [SREcon 2016 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbRoZ5Rrl5lflZ8xrdFAT4BT36y_ycnyx) are waiting, but can wait.

It's time for a break from the blog - I'll see ya when I see ya, thanks for reading.
